## Test Suites

### `vocabs` subdirectory: Vocabulary Reader Test Suite

This directory contains a suite of tests for the vocabulary reader.

Each test is a pair of files `xxx.ttl` and `xxx.json`. The `.ttl` file is
a vocabulary in Turtle format. The `.json` file is the same vocabulary,
re-expressed in our JSON representation.
